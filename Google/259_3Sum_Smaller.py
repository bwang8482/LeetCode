"""
Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.

Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:

[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]
Follow up:
Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?

"""Solution:
    1. traverse the boundary for k
    2. two pointer to track i and j
